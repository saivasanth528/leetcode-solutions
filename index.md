## Getting started

### About

This repository is a collection of my explanations to the leetcode problems. Along with the explanation, a working code snippet (passing all test cases in the leetcode website) is also included in the write-ups.

Hence, the solutions won't directly execute on your local IDE or compiler, the main() would need to be written and the solution's function would need to be invoked with appropriate inputs/test cases to run in standalone.

### How to contribute?

1. Fork the repository.

2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify).

3. Make sure you've followed the existing coding standards and pattern of pasting the entire problem statement with a link to the problem on Leetcode. For reference, you can follow any existing file in this Repo. e.g. [SmallestGoodBase.java](https://github.com/kshitijmishra23/leetCode/blob/master/java/SmallestGoodBase.java)

4. Attach a screenshot from Leetcode showing that your solution was ACCEPTED by the online judge.

5. Make a pull request.

### When to contribute?

1. If your solution's time complexity ‚è∞ is better than the solution already present or,

2. If your solution's space complexity üíæ is better than the solution already present or,

3. If your solution is of the same time and space complexity but is easier/more readable üìÑ to understand or,

4. If your solution is of the same time and space complexity but your explanation is more intuitive/relatable or easy to understand.
